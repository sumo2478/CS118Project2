Project members: Collin Yen, Alex Guo, Andre Hsu

Collin Yen: Handled the IP forwarding, the ARP request and reply, and a lot
of the ICMP

Andre Hsu: Handled the ARP Cache

Alex Guo: Handled part of the ICMP

We created separate files for handling ip in sr_ip.h/c, arp in sr_arp.h/c,
and icmp in sr_icmp.h/c. It was also necessary for us to modify sr_router.c
and sr_arpcache.c.
